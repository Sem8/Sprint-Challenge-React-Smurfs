 1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

 1 answer: Client side routing is when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript loaded on the page.
 Client side routing is not Search Engine Optimization (SEO) friendly, takes longer to load for the first time, navigation speed is faster
 because browser doesn't load other html files. Server side routing is when a new page is requested from the server by say an event like user
 clicking on a link. Server side routing only delivers the requested page, initial load is faster, it's secure, utilizes
 caching well but full page reload for any request is a con and always requires page reload.
